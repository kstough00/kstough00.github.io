Welcome to my first project blog post! I was pretty intimidated going into this project since it is our first one and I am still fine tuning my basic coding skills. Recently news of a live action Avatar the Last Airbender series was released by Netflix and would be airing some time in the next 2 years. This news has created an increased interest in the original Avatar the Last Airbender cartoon that aired on Nickelodeon in the early 2000's, and I wanted to be able to create a program that would be relevant to current events happening in the world to ensure my program would be helpful to its user in some capacity. This is where I decided to complete my CLI project on the Nations and characters displayed in the original Avatar the Last Airbender cartoon. I am also a huge fan of the show and have been since my childhood, therefore I found this to be the perfect subject for my first project!

I would say the most challenging part of this project was getting all of my folders to sync with one another so that they were able to pull information from each other to give the data/experience I wanted the user to have. Once I got all of my gems set up, my next chellenge was getting the information i needed from my API in the format I wanted it to be in. This section took up the majority of my time during the process, however it was also the most rewarding part of my process once I was able to figure it out.

The least challenging part of my project, which came as a surprise to me, was writing the actual methods needed to give my classes the functionality they needed to run my program. I was not expecting this because of how 'new' I am to coding and with only being 4 weeks through the course. Once I realized that I actually do know what I am doing, I began to look at my code in a different way, less resentful and more so 'on the attack'. I began to look at the errors in my code as a new challenge to tackle instead of getting frustrated that it did now work how I wrote it the first time.

I really would like to thank my cohort leads and classmates for always being willing and available to help me out when I hit a snag. I wouldn't have been able to comlete my project without them and am so thankful for the support community that Flatiron is able to provide to its students.
